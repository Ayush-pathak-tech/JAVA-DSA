/*
    In Java:
    - Arrays are objects stored in the HEAP.
    - Heap memory is dynamically allocated by JVM.
    - Heap memory may NOT be continuous because JVM uses
      free memory blocks wherever available.
    - Unlike C/C++, Java manages memory using Garbage Collector.
    - JVM decides where to place the array, so it's not always
      in one big continuous block in physical memory.
    - Logically (from program view) it looks continuous, but 
      physically it may be scattered.

    Diagram:

        Heap Memory:
        +---+    +---+---+    +---+
        |10 |    |20 |30 |    |40 |
        +---+    +---+---+    +---+
          ↑        ↑   ↑        ↑
         arr[0]  arr[1] arr[2] arr[3]

    (Indexes are continuous for us, but data in HEAP
     may be stored in different free spaces internally)



    *********************************************************

    Example:
--------
int[] arr;           // Declaration -> arr is null by default
arr = null;          // Explicitly setting it to null
arr = new int[5];    // Now memory allocated in heap

Diagram:
---------
   Before Initialization:
   arr ---> null (no memory)

   After Initialization (new int[5]):
   arr ---> [0][0][0][0][0]
            (heap memory allocated)

Key point:
----------
Null array means only the REFERENCE exists, but no actual array object in heap.
